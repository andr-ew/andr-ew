## hi i'm and

I release [music](https://andrewcs.bandcamp.com/) as andrew cs

I run a visual design & web development studio called [ampersands](https://ampersands.space/)

I also made some scripts for [norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/)
- [wrms](https://github.com/andr-ew/wrms): dual echo looper
- [orgn](https://github.com/andr-ew/orgn): an fm synth loosely inspired by the yamaha portasound series
- [orgnwrms](https://github.com/andr-ew/orgnwrms): orgn & wrms combined
- [ndls](https://github.com/andr-ew/ndls): a modeless tape looper, delay, & sampler for the monome [grid](https://monome.org/docs/grid/)
- [rpls](https://github.com/andr-ew/rpls): a varispeed multitap echo
- [eels](https://github.com/andr-ew/eels): dual delay / comb filter
- [eggs](https://github.com/andr-ew/eggs): a multi-track gesture sequencer for the monome grid
- [grvl](https://github.com/andr-ew/grvl): dual data pavement
- [eggsrpls](https://github.com/andr-ew/eggsrpls): eggs & rpls combined

in 2019 I made some devices in max for live, most of them don't work anymore because computers kept changing
